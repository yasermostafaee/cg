# runtime-template-library Specification (delta)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Import a `.vcg` template into the runtime library

The Runtime SHALL let the operator upload a `.vcg` file, verify it with
`@cg/vcg-format.verify` in the browser, and — on success — register it in the
template library so it can be loaded onto the stack with its field schema shown
in the Inspector. A package that fails verification SHALL register nothing and
surface a clear error. Verification and unpacking run in the renderer (the format
is isomorphic), so no Node APIs are imported into browser code.

The registered field schema SHALL be the template's **full field closure** — the entry
composition's own fields PLUS the fields of every nested composition instance,
namespaced by that instance's stable name — not the entry composition's flat fields
alone. A template whose fields live only inside a nested composition (the D-119 starter
shape: a graphic composition nested in a full-frame positioning composition) SHALL
therefore present those fields to the operator, not an empty form.

#### Scenario: A verified `.vcg` is registered

- **WHEN** the operator uploads a `.vcg` **THEN** it is verified
  (`@cg/vcg-format.verify`) and added to the template registry

#### Scenario: A registered template loads onto the stack with its fields

- **WHEN** a registered template is selected **THEN** it can be loaded onto the
  stack with its field schema in the Inspector

#### Scenario: A package that fails verification registers nothing

- **WHEN** a `.vcg` fails verification **THEN** the operator sees a clear error
  and nothing is registered

#### Scenario: A two-composition starter exposes its nested fields

- **WHEN** a starter whose editable fields live in a NESTED composition (a graphic
  composition nested inside a full-frame composition) is imported **THEN** the
  registered template's field schema includes those nested fields, grouped under the
  nested instance's namespace — the Inspector does NOT show "No fields."

#### Scenario: Nested field values seed and travel under the instance namespace

- **WHEN** such a template is loaded onto the stack **THEN** its field values are seeded
  as a NESTED value object keyed by the composition instance's stable name, and the
  `stack.load` / `stack.update` payload carries that same nested shape unchanged

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The operator Inspector edits nested-composition fields

The Runtime operator Inspector SHALL render a template's nested-composition fields as
labelled groups — one per composition instance, labelled by the instance's display label
(falling back to its namespace name) — with the entry composition's own fields rendered
at the top level as today. Groups SHALL nest to arbitrary depth.

An edit to a nested field SHALL stage, apply, and reach the wire through the SAME
staged-edit path as a flat field (R-003): it stages into the item's draft, applies as one
atomic `stack.update`, and arrives in the `CG UPDATE` data payload under the SAME nested
key (`{ instanceName: { fieldId: value } }`) that the template's binding resolves at
render. Two fields with the SAME id in different compositions SHALL remain distinct,
because each is addressed within its own instance namespace.

#### Scenario: Nested fields render as labelled groups

- **WHEN** the operator selects a stack item whose template has nested-composition fields
  **THEN** the Inspector shows a labelled group per composition instance containing that
  composition's fields

#### Scenario: A nested field edit round-trips to the wire under its binding key

- **WHEN** the operator edits a nested field and applies **THEN** the `stack.update`
  payload nests the value under the instance namespace, and the `CG UPDATE` data argument
  carries `{ "<instanceName>": { "<fieldId>": <value> } }` — the exact key the template
  runtime's binding reads, so the graphic re-renders with the new value

#### Scenario: Same-named fields in different compositions stay distinct

- **WHEN** two nested composition instances each declare a field with the same id
  **THEN** editing one does NOT change the other, because each value is addressed under
  its own instance namespace
