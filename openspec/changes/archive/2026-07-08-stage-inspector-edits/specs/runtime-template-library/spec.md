# runtime-template-library (R-003 — staged Inspector edits)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The operator Inspector edits structured list fields without coercion

The Runtime operator Inspector SHALL edit a `list` (array) dynamic field — e.g. a
ticker's Data key — with a **structured items editor**, preserving the field value's
`ListItem[]` structure through display, edit, and the applied `stack.update`
payload. The editor SHALL preserve each item's stable `id` and any other (unknown)
fields, and SHALL support add / remove / reorder. Item text MAY span multiple
lines: the per-item editor SHALL be a multi-line control that preserves newlines in
an item's `text` on display AND when applied (lines are never joined/flattened),
and pressing Enter inside it SHALL insert a newline — never commit or submit. A
list value SHALL NEVER be rendered in a plain text input nor `String()`-coerced
(which produces `"[object Object]"`); a non-array value (including a legacy
`"[object Object]"` string) SHALL yield an empty items editor, not a corrupted text
field. Edits (item text, add, remove, reorder) SHALL stage locally and reach the
bridge ONLY when the operator applies the item (the Update button — see "The
operator Inspector stages edits"); the applied field value SHALL be the structured
array, so the `CG ADD` / `CG UPDATE` JSON carries real items, not a stringified
array.

#### Scenario: A list field renders an items editor, not "[object Object]"

- **WHEN** a stack item with a `list` field (e.g. a ticker's `_tickerTexts`) is
  selected **THEN** the Inspector renders an items editor (one editable multi-line
  control per item showing the item's text) and never displays `"[object Object]"`

#### Scenario: Editing an item preserves structure and ships structured JSON

- **WHEN** the operator edits an item's text (or adds / removes / reorders items)
  and then applies the item **THEN** the Inspector sends the value via `stack.update`
  as a structured `ListItem[]` array (each item keeping its `id` + other fields) —
  not a `String()`-coerced string — so the on-air `CG UPDATE` payload carries real
  items

#### Scenario: A non-array value does not corrupt the editor

- **WHEN** the field value is not an array (undefined, or a legacy stringified
  value) **THEN** the editor shows no items (ready to add) rather than a text input
  containing `"[object Object]"`

#### Scenario: A multi-line item survives editing (newline never flattened)

- **WHEN** the operator types a two-line item text — pressing Enter for the line
  break — and applies the item **THEN** Enter inserts a newline (it does not commit
  or submit), the applied `ListItem[]` carries the item's `text` with the `\n`
  intact, and the editor keeps displaying both lines (the lines are never joined)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The operator Inspector stages edits until an explicit apply

Inspector edits SHALL stage locally and SHALL NOT reach the bridge on change,
blur, or Enter. All field kinds stage — scalars, textareas, and list operations
(item text, add, remove, reorder). Enter in a textarea SHALL insert a newline;
Enter in a single-line input SHALL commit nothing.

The item's staged field-set SHALL be applied by an explicit control — the stack
row's Update button, with an equivalent apply control in the Inspector — as ONE
atomic `stack.update` carrying the complete field-set (no per-field sends). The
apply control SHALL remain usable even when nothing is staged, so an operator can
re-send unchanged values (the B-048 recovery workaround); staged state SHALL be
communicated by dirty markers, not by disabling apply.

Staged-but-unapplied state SHALL be visible: dirty fields carry a marker, a
Discard control reverts drafts to the last applied values, and a dirty item is
marked in the stack row so the operator sees that on-air values differ from the
draft. Drafts SHALL be per stack item and SHALL survive selection changes within
the session.

Take, Out, and Remove SHALL NOT apply drafts: Take plays the last applied values
and the item stays visibly dirty. Incoming stack-state pushes SHALL NOT clobber
in-progress drafts — an un-staged field follows the pushed value, a staged field
keeps its draft, and neither a push nor a commit re-mounts the editor (the first
click on a list control always lands; typing during a push never loses keystrokes).

#### Scenario: Edits stage and never reach air on blur or Enter

- **WHEN** the operator types in a field and blurs or presses Enter **THEN** no
  `stack.update` is sent, the on-air values are unchanged, and the field shows a
  dirty marker

#### Scenario: Update applies the whole staged set atomically

- **WHEN** the operator has staged several field edits and clicks Update **THEN**
  the Inspector sends exactly one `stack.update` carrying the complete field-set,
  the B-044 lifecycle settles the badge, and the dirty markers clear

#### Scenario: Discard reverts drafts to the applied values

- **WHEN** the operator has staged edits and clicks Discard **THEN** every field
  reverts to the last applied value and no `stack.update` is sent

#### Scenario: Apply is available with nothing staged (B-048 workaround)

- **WHEN** no edit is staged **THEN** the Update control still sends the item's
  current applied values (the operator's recovery path), rather than being disabled

#### Scenario: Drafts survive selection changes and are per item

- **WHEN** the operator stages an edit, selects another stack item, then returns
  **THEN** the draft is intact and unrelated items carry no draft

#### Scenario: Take does not apply a draft

- **WHEN** an item has a staged edit and the operator clicks Take **THEN** the last
  applied values play (not the draft) and the item stays visibly dirty

#### Scenario: A state push does not clobber an in-progress draft

- **WHEN** a stack-state push arrives while a field is staged **THEN** the staged
  field keeps its draft value, un-staged fields reflect the push, the editor does
  not re-mount, and the first click on a list add/remove/reorder control still lands
