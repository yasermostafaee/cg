# runtime-ui (B-056 — owned-slot occupancy warning surface)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Owned-slot occupancy warning surface without a direct Clear

The Runtime UI SHALL surface the bridge's owned-slot occupancy warnings as a
persistent warning strip DISTINCT from the R-009 orphan rows: one row per
warning naming the channel-layer AND the item it was raised for, rendered
with `role="alert"`, visible while the warning persists (no auto-dismiss),
and rendered NOT AT ALL when the set is empty — no idle noise. The surface
SHALL subscribe to the pushed warning set and load the initial state on
mount.

An owned-slot row SHALL offer NO direct Clear control — the remedy is
Out/Remove of the named item (the bridge refuses `layers.clear` on owned
layers), and the row text SHALL say so. The row disappears only when the
bridge resolves the warning (a CLEAR provably landing on the primary, the
item's removal, or a server reconfiguration).

#### Scenario: Warnings appear naming layer and item; idle is quiet

- **WHEN** the bridge publishes a non-empty owned-slot warning set **THEN**
  the warning strip appears naming each channel-layer and its item, with the
  Out/Remove remedy
- **WHEN** the warning set is empty **THEN** no owned-slot warning surface
  is rendered

#### Scenario: No Clear button on an owned-slot row

- **WHEN** an owned-slot warning row is rendered **THEN** it contains no
  Clear control (unlike an R-009 orphan row, whose confirm-gated Clear is
  unchanged)

#### Scenario: Out/Remove of the named item resolves the row

- **WHEN** the operator removes (or outs, with the CLEAR landing on the
  primary) the named item and the bridge publishes the resolution **THEN**
  the row disappears
