# runtime-caspar-bridge (surface orphan layers — R-009)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Orphaned layer occupancy is swept, surfaced, and operator-clearable

The bridge SHALL periodically compare server-side layer occupancy against the
layers it owns and surface every mismatch as an orphan: a layer whose
foreground producer is non-empty on the CURRENT PRIMARY, observed fresh, and
whose (channel, layer) is not owned by the bridge (not a reserved slot).
Occupancy SHALL be sourced from a passive tap on the already-parsed OSC
producer stream — upstream of the interest filter, adding no events to the
OSC pipeline and no AMCP traffic — so the interest set, rate limiter, and
change tracker (the B-044 firehose protections) remain untouched. (Verified
on CasparCG 2.5.0: AMCP `INFO` carries no per-layer data on the 2.3+
lineage; OSC is the only per-layer occupancy signal.)

The sweep SHALL run on a bounded periodic cadence, query only the current
primary (following it across failover and reconfiguration), and skip while
the primary session is not healthy — existing warnings freeze rather than
falsely resolve while disconnected. Surfacing SHALL be debounced (an orphan
appears after consecutive sightings; it resolves on the first sweep that
observes the layer empty or no longer reported) and published only when the
orphan set changes. The sweep timer SHALL be disposed with the runtime.

The orphan set SHALL be pullable (`layers.orphans`) and pushed on change
(`layers.orphans-changed`). A `layers.clear` request SHALL send an urgent
`CLEAR <channel>-<layer>` for a surfaced layer — refusing (`reason: 'owned'`)
any layer the bridge owns (clearing owned layers is Out/Remove's job) and
never touching slots or interest it does not own; a CLEAR executed on the
current primary counts as layer adoption. The warning resolves only on the
next sweep's observed empty — never optimistically, and the bridge SHALL
NEVER clear a layer without an explicit operator request.

#### Scenario: A foreign producer surfaces within the sweep cadence

- **WHEN** a producer exists on a layer the bridge does not own (e.g. left by
  a dead bridge session) and the primary session is healthy **THEN** within
  two sweep cycles the layer is surfaced as an orphan, named by
  channel-layer, and published to connected clients

#### Scenario: Owned layers never surface; idle is quiet

- **WHEN** every non-empty layer maps to a bridge-owned slot **THEN** no
  orphan is surfaced and nothing is published (no idle noise, no per-tick
  logging)

#### Scenario: Operator Clear resolves on observed empty

- **WHEN** the operator invokes `layers.clear` on a surfaced layer **THEN**
  the bridge sends `CLEAR <ch>-<layer>` (urgent) and the warning resolves on
  the next sweep that observes the layer empty or gone silent
- **WHEN** `layers.clear` names a layer the bridge owns **THEN** the request
  is refused with `reason: 'owned'` and nothing is sent

#### Scenario: The sweep follows the primary and freezes when it is down

- **WHEN** a failover or runtime reconfiguration switches the primary
  **THEN** subsequent sweeps read the new primary's occupancy
- **WHEN** the primary session is not healthy **THEN** the sweep skips and
  previously surfaced warnings persist unchanged (absence of knowledge never
  resolves a warning)
