# Platform / infra / tooling — backlog

Cross-cutting items: shared packages, build/hosting, tests. See `README.md`.

## [ ] P-001 — Bundle Vazirmatn offline ⟨priority: medium⟩

**What:** Ship the Vazirmatn font with the apps instead of loading it from the
jsdelivr CDN, and tighten the CSP accordingly.
**Why:** Broadcast machines are often air-gapped; a CDN `<link>` breaks Persian
rendering offline and forces a loose CSP.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN an app loads with no network THEN Persian text still renders in Vazirmatn
- WHEN the app loads THEN the CSP no longer needs `cdn.jsdelivr.net`
  **Notes:** add `@fontsource/vazirmatn`, import it in each app entry, drop the
  `<link>` in `index.html`. Touches `@cg/ui` font stack + both apps.

## [ ] P-002 — Lightweight routing / app shell ⟨priority: low⟩

**What:** Introduce simple routing so each app can have more than one screen
(e.g. editor / library / settings).
**Why:** Both apps are single-screen; settings and library will need routes.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the operator navigates between views THEN the URL reflects the view and
  back/forward work
  **Notes:** keep it minimal; this is the seam the zip's TanStack Router pattern
  could fill if desired.

## [ ] P-003 — Hosting / packaging recipe ⟨priority: low⟩

**What:** Decide and document how operators get the apps — static hosting vs a
small local server that also embeds the CasparCG bridge.
**Why:** No distribution story yet now that there's no installer.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN following the doc THEN a non-developer can serve Designer and Runtime
  (and, for Runtime, start the bridge) on an operator machine
  **Notes:** a single local binary serving the SPA + the bridge is the smoothest
  no-IT option; relates to C-001.

## [ ] P-004 — Deepen platform tests ⟨priority: low⟩

**What:** Add tests for the Designer `Exporter` (pack → download) and `Preview`
behind their DI seams, and re-add integration coverage once the bridge exists.
**Why:** The migration removed Electron-era tests; export/preview paths are
under-covered.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the test suite runs THEN Exporter produces a valid `.vcg` for a sample
  scene and Preview builds a document for a scene
  **Notes:** `Exporter`/`Preview` already take `cgJs`/`cgCss` via constructor, so
  they're testable without the `?raw` bundle.

## [x] P-005 — Designer E2E + UI test coverage (Playwright), built to scale ⟨priority: high⟩ — archived: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-15-add-designer-e2e-testing/`

**What:** A Playwright browser-E2E harness for the Designer SPA, built so FUTURE
features inherit coverage by default. Runs the SAME shipped build in a test mode
(`window.CG_E2E` → `MemoryWorkspace` + `MemoryKv`, no native dialogs), with reusable
page-object fixtures for common actions, an initial suite covering the critical
flows + recent bug regressions, a separate required CI job, and a CLAUDE.md rule
that maps each OpenSpec `#### Scenario` to Playwright steps.
**Why:** There was no E2E/UI coverage — only unit tests. Integrated flows (canvas →
inspector → preview → export) and cross-cutting regressions were unguarded, and new
features had no default path to E2E coverage.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN `pnpm test:e2e` runs (locally or in CI) THEN the Designer boots against the
  built app in test mode with NO native file dialogs, and the suite runs headless
- WHEN a test is written THEN it composes reusable fixtures (newComposition,
  addTextElement, setDataKey, bindFromCanvas, openPreviewModal, play/stop/pause,
  addKeyframeViaDiamond, dragShape, nestCompositionInstance, setPlayoutTiming,
  exportHtml) instead of rewriting boilerplate
- WHEN the critical flow runs THEN create composition → add text with a data key →
  preview (edit field value live) → lifecycle play/hold/stop → export single-file
  HTML all pass
- WHEN the recent fixes are exercised THEN their regressions pass (diamond keyframe
  captures current value; colour edits sync display+shape; bind-once + disable;
  data-key resync on selection change; per-composition + nested namespaced field
  scope in the parent preview; nested-lifecycle cascade; per-scope preview timing)
- WHEN CI runs THEN a separate `e2e` job (Chromium cached) runs the suite and is
  required green, kept out of the fast unit gate
- WHEN a future change adds user-facing behavior THEN it MUST add an E2E test mapping
  its OpenSpec scenarios to Playwright steps (CLAUDE.md rule)
  **Notes:** test mode = `window.CG_E2E` set by Playwright `addInitScript` before app
  JS (test-only; a real user can't trigger it); built app via `vite preview`
  (matches turbo `test:e2e` dependsOn build); E2E lives in `apps/designer/tests/e2e`.
  Change: `openspec/changes/add-designer-e2e-testing/`.

## [!] P-006 — End-user product documentation site (Loopic-style) ⟨priority: low⟩ — blocked: post-feature-stabilization / GTM

**What:** A public, end-user-facing documentation site for the CG platform —
getting-started, building a lower-third/ticker/fullscreen, data fields & bindings,
preview/playout, export to `.vcg`, and a CasparCG operator guide — in the style of
Loopic's product docs. Audience is broadcast operators & template authors, NOT
contributors.
**Why:** Today's docs are engineer-facing (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/engines/`, OpenSpec,
`docs/operator-guide/`). When the product stabilizes and we go to market, end users
will need approachable, task-oriented docs with screenshots/video — a different
artifact from the internal architecture docs.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN a new operator follows "getting started" THEN they can build, preview, and
  export a working lower-third without reading any code or internal docs
- WHEN a feature ships THEN its user-facing behavior has a docs page (mirrors how
  OpenSpec scenarios + E2E grow with features)
  **Notes:** TRACKED, NOT BUILT NOW — explicitly deferred until feature set
  stabilizes and a GTM motion exists (hence `[!]` blocked). Likely a static docs
  site (e.g. Astro Starlight / VitePress) separate from the engineer docs; reuse
  `docs/operator-guide/` + `docs/designer-guide/` content as seeds. Internal
  architecture docs (`docs/engines/`, package READMEs) stay the source of truth for
  _how it's built_; this is the _how to use it_ layer.

## [ ] P-007 — Extract domain skills from scattered docs ⟨priority: low⟩

**What:** Package situational domain knowledge as Claude Code **skills** instead
of always-on CLAUDE.md rules: (a) **caspar-template** — the CG ADD+UPDATE
sequence, `file://`-safe/IIFE constraints, CSP, the CEF floor, the 403 readiness
trap, GDD rules; (b) **persian-rtl** — ZWNJ, per-item bidi isolation, crawl
direction, mixed-content test patterns; (c) **engine-extension** — a thin
wrapper over the existing engine READMEs' extension points.
**Why:** This expertise is scattered across docs and only matters situationally;
packaged as skills it loads on demand instead of bloating the always-on context.
**Acceptance:**

- To be detailed when the item is scheduled.
  **Notes:** Boundary rule — always-on behavioral rules STAY in CLAUDE.md;
  skills are for situational expertise. Sequenced post-feature-wave; see
  `docs/ROADMAP.md` ("Then — infra/quality").

## [x] P-008 — Skip heavy CI for docs-only PRs ⟨priority: medium⟩ — implemented; change `openspec/changes/skip-ci-for-docs-only/`

**What:** وقتی یک PR **فقط** فایل‌های docs/markdown را عوض کرده
(`openspec/**`, `docs/**`, `**/*.md`)، jobهای سنگینِ CI (`pr.yml` —
typecheck/lint/test/build/e2e) skip شوند و فقط یک چکِ سبکِ docs (مثلاً
`openspec validate --all --strict` + `format:check`) بدود. PRهای کد دقیقاً مثلِ
امروز کلِ gate را می‌دوند.
**Why:** archiveها و ویرایش‌های docs کد را لمس نمی‌کنند، ولی الان کلِ تست/بیلد/e2e
را تریگر می‌کنند و merge را معطل می‌گذارند. این بزرگ‌ترین معطلیِ غیرضروری در گردشِ
کار است.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN یک PR فقط `openspec/**` / `docs/**` / `**/*.md` را تغییر داده THEN jobهای
  سنگین (typecheck/lint/test/build/e2e) skip می‌شوند و فقط چکِ سبکِ docs می‌دود و
  required سبز می‌شود
- WHEN یک PR حتی یک فایلِ کد/تست/بیلد را تغییر داده THEN کلِ green gate ِ امروز
  (typecheck/lint/test/build + e2e) می‌دود — هیچ کدی بی‌تست merge نشود
- WHEN branch protection چکِ required دارد THEN چکِ docs-only همان نقش را بازی کند
  (PR ِ docs بدونِ green gate ِ کامل هم mergeable شود)

**Notes:** با `paths`/`paths-ignore` یا یک path-filter در `pr.yml` (یا یک job ِ
شرطیِ جدا). **ریسکِ ظریف:** filter باید دقیق باشد — اگر کد اشتباهاً در یک PR ِ
«docs» قاطی شود نباید بی‌تست بگذرد؛ پس شرطِ «هیچ فایلِ غیرdocs تغییر نکرده» را
محکم بگذار (نه صرفاً «شاملِ docs هست»). به branch protection / required checks ِ
گیتهاب وابسته است — ممکن است تنظیمِ required check هم لازم باشد تا PR ِ docs بدونِ
آن jobهای skip‌شده mergeable بماند (این لبهٔ معروفِ «required check که skip شده،
PR را بلاک می‌کند» را موقعِ پیاده‌سازی بررسی کن). infra/CI — یک‌بار کار.

## [x] P-009 — Self-enforcing local gate for Claude Code sessions (Stop hook) ⟨priority: medium⟩ — merged (#363) + archived: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-19-platform-gate-stop-hook/`

**Archived with 5 tasks still unchecked** (3.2 seven manual hook invocations with recorded exit
codes, 3.3 the caspar-bridge suite green isolated AND under full parallel `pnpm test`, and the
5.x gate/validate/PR trio). The hook is merged and demonstrably live — it has blocked turns and
printed its repair rules repeatedly since. But the archiver had no evidence for those manual
legs and deliberately did not tick boxes it could not stand behind: a false tick destroys the
record's value, which is the whole point of ticking. Re-run them if the record matters.

**What:** A committed Claude Code Stop hook that refuses to let a session's turn end
with a red local gate: it classifies the turn's changed files (working tree ∪ branch
commits vs the `origin/main` merge-base), runs the matching gate — the docs-only
carve-out (`openspec validate --all --strict` + `format:check`), the full `pnpm gate`,
plus `pnpm gate:e2e` when UI/render paths changed — and on failure feeds the tail of
the failing output back to the session with non-cheating repair rules, at most twice,
before escalating to the human.
**Why:** CI is billing-blocked (~Aug 1), so the local gate is the only merge gate — but
it currently relies on the session REMEMBERING to run it. Turns have ended red; the
E2E gate especially is skipped because it is slow and manual. Enforcement must not
depend on model discipline.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN a turn ends with no changed files (or the session is in plan mode, or the hook
  re-fires after its own block) THEN the hook exits 0 without running anything
- WHEN the changed set is docs-only (every path under `openspec/**`, `docs/**`, or
  `**/*.md`) THEN only the docs-only carve-out runs (openspec validate strict +
  format:check), mirroring CLAUDE.md — never the full gate
- WHEN any non-docs path changed THEN `pnpm gate` runs; and WHEN any changed path is
  in the UI/render set (renderer sources, template-runtime, ui, single-file-export,
  lottie-bridge, `*.css.ts`, e2e specs, playwright configs) THEN `pnpm gate:e2e` runs
  too
- WHEN a gate is red THEN the turn is blocked (exit 2) with the failing tail + repair
  rules that forbid deleting/skipping/loosening tests; after two consecutive red
  attempts in one session THEN the hook stops blocking and surfaces a message telling
  the human the gate needs eyes
- WHEN `gate:e2e` passes on `win32` THEN the green message states the run is
  NON-AUTHORITATIVE for pixel geometry and a Linux/WSL run is still owed
- WHEN the hook's pure decision logic changes THEN unit tests in `tools/gate-hook`
  cover path classification, docs-only detection, UI/render matching, and attempt
  counting
