# Bugs — backlog

Bug reports. Unlike features, every bug needs a **repro** — that's what lets
Claude reproduce, fix, and add a regression test. See `README.md` for IDs and
statuses.

## [x] B-001 — panels position and design ⟨priority: high⟩ — folded into `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-15-add-animation-timeline-dock/`

**Repro:**

1. فونتها و تکستها درشت هستن
2. بعضی مقادیر و آیکونها در پنل پراپرتی وجود ندارند
   **Expected:** دقیقا مثل تصاویر که در تسک D-006 به آنها اشاره شده کل پنلها و دیزاین پیاده سازی شود
   **Actual:** all pics are related to D-006: `docs/designer-guide/sample-assets/D-006-pic-*`
   **Env:** Browser + app (e.g. Chrome / Designer dev) — and whether it reproduces
   in the latest `main`.
   **Notes:** check this website https://app.loopic.io/studio and crawl and see all the codes, i have got those screenshots from this website

## [x] B-002 — point frames action ⟨priority: high⟩ — folded into `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-15-add-animation-timeline-dock/`

**Repro:**

1. درست کار نکردن پوینتها
2. عدم نمایش پراپرتی درست مربوط به پوینتها
   **Expected:**
   وقتی روی یک پوینت کلیک میکنیم باید در قسمت لایه ها هم رنگ آیکون پوینت در لایه مربوطه زرد شود و همچنین در بخش پراپرتی یعنی پنل سمت راست باید آیکون پونت وجود داشته باشه
   دقیقا مثل تصاویر قرار داده شده
   چیزی که الان نمایش داده میشه زمانی که روی پوینتها کلیک میکنیم مناسب زمانیست که دابل کلیک کنیم نه کلیک

برای هر پوینت باید مقدار متفاوت وجود داشته باشه یعنی اگر در لایه positionx 3 تا پوینت داریم هر کدوم باید بتونن مقادیر متفاوت داشته باشن
**Actual:** What happens instead (error text / screenshot path if any).
**Env:**  
**Notes:** تصاویر مربوط به تسک D-006 رو با دقت بسیار بسیار بالا بررسی کن

## [~] B-003 — point frames style ⟨priority: high⟩ — focused fix

**Repro:**

1. framepoint color style is wrong

**Expected:**
❯
A- We have 2 states of a framepoint on properties area on right panel and on the left of the timeline area:
1- Empty: if a point exist or not it just shows an empty point.
2- Index is exactly on the same frame with a point: point on properties areas must be yellow.

B- We have 2 states of a framepoint on the timeline area:
1- all framepoints are yellow.
2- A point is selected: use a blue border around the selected point and also the line after that.

just use a curve tiny line on the line between framepoints not a "f" letter.

**Actual:**
**Env:**  
**Notes:** see screenshots in: `docs/designer-guide/sample-assets/B-003-pic-*`

## [x] B-004 — rotation style ⟨priority: high⟩

**Repro:**

1. when change the rotaion of a shape or text the transition border and handle wont be changed position.

**Expected:**
work correctly

**Actual:**
**Env:**  
**Notes:** see screenshots in: `docs/designer-guide/sample-assets/B-004-pic-0`
```

Claude's loop for a bug (per `README.md` processing contract): reproduce →
diagnose → fix → **add a regression test** that fails before and passes after →
green gate → commit. Track it as an OpenSpec change only if the fix changes
spec-level behavior; otherwise a focused fix + test is enough (note that in the
proposal/commit).

## [x] B-005 — inspector diamond reverts an animated property to its base value ⟨priority: high⟩ — focused fix

**Repro:**

1. Select a shape; on any animatable property (e.g. Position X) click the diamond at frame F1 to add a keyframe.
2. Move the shape on F1 (the F1 keyframe captures the new value V).
3. Scrub to a later frame F2.
4. Click the diamond (add-keyframe) next to Position X on F2.

**Expected:** a keyframe is added at F2 holding the evaluated value V (the value the field shows and the canvas renders at F2); the shape does not move. (Dragging on F2 already does this correctly.)
**Actual:** the shape reverts to the previous keyframe's pre-move base value — the diamond captured `row.read(element)` (the element's static transform) instead of the evaluated value at the playhead.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev; reproduces on `main` (preview branch).
**Notes:** Root cause shared with B-006 — the inspector read the static value while the canvas drag path reads the evaluated value at the current frame. Fix: `TransformSection.togglePropertyKeyframe` / `StyleSection.animPointIcon` / `TextStyleSection.animPoint` now capture `effectiveAnimatableValue(el, prop, frame, staticFallback)`. Regression test: `apps/designer/tests/store-animation.test.ts` ("B-005 …"). Living-spec scenario added to `openspec/specs/designer-animation-timeline/spec.md`.

## [x] B-006 — colour field display stays stale when the property is animated ⟨priority: high⟩ — focused fix

**Repro:**

1. Select a shape that has a colour keyframe (e.g. a `fill.color` track).
2. With the playhead on a frame, edit the colour in the colour-picker / hex input.

**Expected:** both the input's displayed value AND the shape update to the new colour, and they stay in sync.
**Actual:** the shape changes (the edit lands as a keyframe via `commitAnimatable`), but the input keeps showing the old value — the colour field displayed the element's static `fill.color`/`stroke.color`/text colour instead of the evaluated colour at the current frame.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev; reproduces on `main` (preview branch).
**Notes:** Same root cause as B-005 (read path used the static value, not the evaluated value at the playhead). Fix: colour/numeric display in `StyleSection` + `TextStyleSection` now uses `effectiveColorAt` / `effectiveNumberAt` (new colour-aware evaluators in `keyframe-helpers.ts`). Regression test: `apps/designer/tests/store-animation.test.ts` ("B-006 …").

## [x] B-007 — timeline diamond add-keyframe captures the stale base value (all properties) ⟨priority: high⟩ — focused fix

**Repro:**

1. Select a shape; on any animatable property, click the diamond to add a keyframe at frame F1, then move/edit it there (e.g. Position X → 200). The F1 keyframe correctly holds 200.
2. Move the playhead to a later frame F2. The shape correctly DISPLAYS the held value (200).
3. Click the add-keyframe diamond **in the timeline track row** for that property at F2.

**Expected:** a keyframe is added at F2 with the current evaluated value (200); the shape does not move.
**Actual:** the keyframe is added with the property's ORIGINAL/pre-move base value (e.g. 0) and the shape jumps. Dragging or editing the input at F2 captures the correct value — only the diamond was wrong. Affects ALL animatable property kinds (transform numbers, dimensions, opacity, colour).
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev; reproduces on `main` (preview branch).
**Notes:** Distinct from B-005 (which fixed the **inspector** diamonds). This is the **timeline** track-row diamond — a second add-keyframe path. Root cause: `TrackRowLabel.toggleKeyframeHere` captured `row.read(element)` — the element's static base, which is NOT updated when a keyframe is moved — instead of the evaluated value at the playhead (`effectiveRowValue`, which the row's own value readout already used). Fix: the shared `addOrToggleKeyframeAtFrame` (in `apps/designer/src/renderer/features/timeline/TrackRow.tsx`) now captures `effectiveRowValue(element, row, frame)` — one path, all value kinds. Regression tests: `apps/designer/tests/store-animation.test.ts` ("B-007 …", parametric over position.x / size.w / opacity / fill.color). Living-spec requirement generalized + scenario added in `openspec/specs/designer-animation-timeline/spec.md`.

## [x] B-008 — "Bind from canvas" creates duplicate bindings ⟨priority: high⟩ — focused fix

**Repro:**

1. Give a text element a Data key (creates a field), or add a field manually.
2. On that field click **Bind from canvas**, then click a canvas element. A binding is added and bind mode exits.
3. Re-activate **Bind from canvas** and click the **same** element again. Repeat.

**Expected:** binding the same field to the same target is idempotent — no duplicate is added (e.g. one "text on Text" binding, not five). Binding the field to a _different_ element/target is still allowed.
**Actual:** each activation+click added another identical binding, stacking duplicates (5× "text on Text" for one field).
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev; reproduces on `main` (preview branch).
**Notes:** Two requirements: (a) one activation = one bind — `CanvasOverlay` already exits bind mode (`setBindMode(null)`) after a click, verified; (b) the missing guard — `designerStore.addBinding` now **dedupes**: it no-ops when a binding with the same `fieldId` AND structurally-equal `target` already exists (helper `sameBindingTarget`). Same field → a _different_ target (other element, or same element different property) is still added. Store-level guard protects every caller. Regression test: `apps/designer/tests/fields-and-bindings.test.ts` ("B-008 …"). Spec note: the `designer-dynamic-fields` living spec is absent from the working tree (the `add-dynamic-text-fields` change is deleted), so there is no present spec to add a scenario to — the regression test is the executable spec for this fix.

## [x] B-009 — inspector inputs show a STALE value when switching elements mid-edit ⟨priority: high⟩ — focused fix

**Repro:**

1. Two text elements A and B.
2. Type a Data key (e.g. "text1") into element A's **Data key** input but do NOT press Enter / blur (value uncommitted).
3. Click element B.

**Expected:** the inspector shows B's OWN Data key (empty), not A's in-progress value.
**Actual:** the input shows "text1" (A's uncommitted draft) as B's Data key. Saving was already CORRECT ("text1" saved to A, new typing saves to B) — only the DISPLAY was wrong. Same class of bug on the element **Name** input and the **Title / Description / Pattern / Value** text fields and the **stroke / shadow colour** hex fields.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev; reproduces on `main` (preview branch).
**Notes:** Root cause — these inspector inputs are **uncontrolled** (`defaultValue`, which only applies at mount) and relied on a React `key` derived from the committed **value** (`dk-${currentKey}`, `key-${name}`, `${label}-${value}`). When the selection moves from A to B and both share the same committed value (e.g. both Data keys empty), the key is identical, so React **reuses the same DOM node** and keeps its in-progress draft — A's uncommitted text shows under B. (Commit was fine because `onBlur` fires on A before the switch.) Fix: fold the **selected element id** into each uncontrolled input's key so it re-initialises whenever the selection changes, regardless of value equality — data-key (`dk-${element.id}-${currentKey}`) and Name (`name-${elementId}-${name}`) inputs, and a new `resetKey` prop on the shared `TextField`/`ColorField` (threaded as `element.id` from `StyleSection`/`FieldMeta`, `field.id` from `FieldsPanel`). `RealtimeNumberInput`/`SelectField` are already controlled (buffer resyncs while unfocused / native `value`) and don't exhibit it; the colour popover remounts on open, so it's unaffected. Commit-on-blur is unchanged, so a pending edit still saves to the PREVIOUS element. Regression test: `apps/designer/tests/inspector-input-resync.test.ts` (renders `DynamicDataSection`, types into A, switches to B → B shows its own value AND A's value is saved). Spec: `openspec/changes/fix-inspector-input-selection-resync/` (new `designer-inspector` capability requirement).

## [ ] B-010 — Double-click on a bound text element shows a different value ⟨priority: medium⟩

**Repro:**

1. Bind a text element to a data field (so it renders the field value, not its raw
   authored text).
2. Double-click the element to edit it on the canvas.

**Expected:** editing reflects/keeps the value consistently with what's rendered (no
mismatch between the displayed bound value and the edit surface).
**Actual:** the double-click edit surface shows a different value than the rendered
bound value (the authored/placeholder text vs the field value).
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev — confirm whether it still reproduces on the latest
`main`.
**Notes:** DEFERRED bug, logged for hygiene — **full repro / Expected / Actual and a
regression test to be detailed when scheduled**. Likely the canvas text-edit path
reads the element's authored `text` while the render path applies the binding; relates
to the bindings/`textOriginals` placeholder substitution in `@cg/template-runtime` and
the inspector read-path bugs (B-005/B-006/B-009 family).

## [ ] B-011 — Playwright preview-iframe E2E test is timing-flaky ⟨priority: low⟩

**Repro:**

1. Run the Designer E2E suite (`pnpm --filter @cg/designer test:e2e`) repeatedly.
2. Occasionally the critical-flow test fails at the live-preview assertion (the
   preview iframe hasn't rendered the field value within the 7s `expect` timeout);
   re-running passes.

**Expected:** the preview-iframe assertions are deterministic — they wait on a
"preview ready / rendered" signal, not on elapsed time, so the test never flakes.
**Actual:** intermittently fails on a timing window and passes on re-run.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev + CI. Observed once on the `refactor/store-slices`
branch (the selection-slice commit): `setPreviewField('headline', 'Hello E2E')`
then `expect(previewFrame.getByText('Hello E2E')).toBeVisible()` timed out, green on
re-run. **Pre-existing**, unrelated to that refactor; currently **masked in CI by
`retries: 1`** (`apps/designer/playwright.config.ts`).
**Notes:** DEFERRED test-infra bug, logged for hygiene — **do not fix now.** Spec:
`apps/designer/tests/e2e/critical-flow.spec.ts` (the `compose → data key → live
preview → …` test, ~line 22); fixture: `apps/designer/tests/e2e/fixtures/designer.ts`
(`previewFrame` / `setPreviewField`). Suspected cause: the test waits on timing
rather than a deterministic "preview ready" signal from the iframe. **Proposed fix
(when scheduled):** have the preview iframe expose a readiness flag once the
runtime's ready promise resolves (post a message / set a marker attribute), and make
the E2E fixture wait on THAT instead of on time; then re-evaluate whether `retries: 1`
can stay or be removed.

## [x] B-012 — CI: soak-runner "Reconciler is not a constructor" (typecheck-emit race) ⟨priority: low⟩

**Repro:** nondeterministic in CI (raced twice on PR #79: runs `27288006490`
@ `6c7c00c` and `27288386408` attempt 1 @ `ee4401c`); identical reruns passed.

1. `Lint•Typecheck•Test•Build` failed in `@cg/soak-runner`
   `tests/harness.test.ts` — 7/9 tests with `TypeError: Reconciler is not a
constructor` (the `@cg/caspar-client` import resolved to undefined).

**Expected:** soak-runner's vitest always sees a fully-built
`caspar-client/dist`.
**Actual — root cause (diagnosed, fixed):** NOT an API drift and NOT a one-off:
soak-runner type-checks and passes 9/9 against current `@cg/caspar-client`
built from a fully clean tree. The real bug: lib packages used
`typecheck: tsc -b`, which **emits `dist/`** — the same files `build` emits —
while turbo's `typecheck` task declared only `*.tsbuildinfo` outputs and had
**no edge to the package's own `build`** (both depend only on `^build`), so
`X#typecheck` and `X#build` ran two concurrent `tsc -b` over the same
`dist/` + `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`. Turbo snapshotted `caspar-client#build`
outputs while the sibling typecheck `tsc` was still writing → torn dist in the
cache artifact → restored on cache hit in the Test step (the
"`@cg/caspar-client:build` output inside the Test step" was cache-hit log
replay accompanying that restore) → vitest imported a half-written dist →
`Reconciler` undefined. Reruns passed because the failed job skipped its
"Post Cache Turbo" upload, so the poisoned artifact never left the runner.
**Env:** GitHub Actions; widest race window on broad cache invalidation
(schema change → many packages rebuilding concurrently).
**Notes:** FIXED — `fix/turbo-typecheck-emit-race`: every `typecheck`
script is now plain-mode `tsc --noEmit` with a private
`--tsBuildInfoFile typecheck.tsbuildinfo` (pure reader; build mode is out:
`tsc -b --noEmit` TS6310-fails whenever a referenced project is out of date,
and otherwise writes tsbuildinfo across the whole reference closure — other
packages' build state). Turbo's `typecheck` task declares `outputs: []` so no
stale state is ever restored over a build's coherent dist+tsbuildinfo pair,
and the `build` task's outputs exclude `typecheck.tsbuildinfo` so build
artifacts stay deterministic.
Regression pin: `tools/soak-runner/tests/typecheck-no-emit.test.ts` (fails if
any workspace typecheck script can emit, or turbo typecheck regrows outputs).
Also fixed alongside: `@cg/template-fixtures#build` turbo outputs/inputs (CI
warned "no output files found"; outputs go to repo-root `fixtures/templates/**`
and its real inputs are `build.mjs` + `*.scene.mjs`, so cache hits never
restored the fixtures and scene edits didn't bust the cache).

## [ ] B-013 — `clean` scripts fail on Windows (rimraf 6 + unexpanded glob) ⟨priority: low⟩

**Repro:**

1. On Windows, run `pnpm --filter @cg/audit clean` (or `pnpm turbo run clean`).

**Expected:** `dist` and `*.tsbuildinfo` removed in every package.
**Actual:** rimraf 6 receives the literal `*.tsbuildinfo` (no shell glob
expansion on Windows) and exits 1 before deleting anything, so
`pnpm turbo run clean` aborts mid-graph. POSIX shells expand the glob first, so
CI/dev on Linux/macOS is unaffected.
**Env:** Windows only; all packages with `clean: rimraf dist *.tsbuildinfo`.
**Notes:** Fix is mechanical: `rimraf --glob dist "*.tsbuildinfo"` in every
package's clean script. Surfaced while reproducing B-012 from a clean tree.

## [x] B-014 — Switching a keyframed colour fill to gradient leaves an orphaned, still-applied colour track ⟨priority: high⟩

**Repro:**

1. Select a shape; give its `fill.color` (solid) a couple of keyframes so the colour animates.
2. In the inspector switch the fill from **solid** to **gradient** (or linear).

**Expected:** switching to a fill mode that is NOT keyframe-able removes the colour keyframes for that property (one undo step); the gradient renders statically and is freely editable; no colour animation remains.
**Actual:** the diamond correctly disappears (D-051: gradient isn't keyframe-able), BUT the previous colour keyframes are NOT removed — they stay on the track and the runtime KEEPS animating the colour, while the gradient colour can't be edited; switching back to solid reveals the keyframes were never gone, just hidden. UI says "not keyframe-able" while the data + playout engine still animate it — an inconsistent half-state.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev; reproduces on `main` after D-051. PRE-EXISTING (the orphaned track predates D-051; D-051 only corrected the diamond's visibility, which exposed the contradiction). Affects every colour property with a solid↔gradient distinction — `fill` on shapes AND `text.color` / `backgroundColor` on text (same keyframeable-iff-solid rule from D-051's registry).
**Notes:** Decision (owner): **Option A** — switching to a non-keyframe-able fill/colour mode DELETES that property's keyframes, as ONE undo step (so an accidental switch is recoverable via undo). Fix where the fill/colour MODE is changed (the inspector's solid→gradient switch handler — likely in `FillPopover.tsx` / the colour-field commit path): when the new mode makes the property non-keyframe-able, remove that property's keyframe track in the same store transaction. Use D-051's registry predicate (`keyframeable(el)` — the gradient ⇒ false rule already exists) as the SINGLE source for "is this still keyframe-able", so the delete triggers exactly when the diamond would disappear — no parallel condition. Cover ALL solid↔gradient colour properties (shape `fill`, text `text.color` + `backgroundColor`), not just shape fill. Regression test: keyframe a solid fill → switch to gradient → assert the colour track is gone, the runtime no longer animates the colour, and one undo restores both the solid mode and its keyframes; parametrize over shape-fill + text-colour. (Confirm during repro that the runtime currently DOES still apply the orphaned track — i.e. the colour visibly animates after the switch — and that the value also stops being editable; if the observed symptom differs, report before fixing.) **DONE** — fixed on `main` (PR #97, `10cf6c8`: `clearOrphanColourTrack` in `fill-commit.ts`). No OpenSpec change; the regression tests are B-014's spec — `apps/designer/tests/fill-commit.test.ts` (unit, parametrized over shape-fill + text-colour) and `apps/designer/tests/e2e/regressions.spec.ts` (E2E).

## [x] B-019 — Dragging an image THUMBNAIL doesn't add it to the canvas (native img-drag steals the cell drag) ⟨priority: medium⟩

**Repro:**

1. Open the Project Assets panel with at least one imported image.
2. Drag the asset by its **thumbnail picture** onto the canvas.

**Expected:** an image element is inserted at the drop point (same as dragging by the asset
NAME), with a drag ghost showing the whole cell (image + name).
**Actual:** nothing is inserted, and the drag ghost is the image ONLY. Dragging by the NAME
works (inserts; ghost = image + name). It looks size-related (a large thumbnail "fails")
only because a bigger thumbnail fills the cell, so the grab lands on the `<img>`.
**Env:** Browser / Designer; both grid and list layouts of the assets panel.
**Root cause:** in `AssetThumb.tsx` the cell `<div>` is `draggable` and its `onDragStart`
sets `dataTransfer 'application/x-cg-asset-id'` (the key the canvas drop reads —
`CanvasOverlay.onDrop`). But the thumbnail `<img>` is **natively draggable**, so grabbing
the picture starts a browser image-drag (no `x-cg-asset-id` payload → the drop sees nothing →
no insert; ghost = the image). Grabbing the name (a `<span>`, not natively draggable) bubbles
to the cell drag, which works (default ghost = the whole cell). The `<img>` is the only
natively-draggable child of the cell.
**Fix:** set `draggable={false}` on the thumbnail `<img>` so the cell `<div>` is the SOLE drag
source. Both grab points then start the cell drag → the payload is set (canvas inserts the
image) AND the default ghost becomes the whole cell (image + name) consistently. No custom
`setDragImage` — the default cell ghost is already the desired image+name. Code defect, no
behaviour spec change (the drag-onto-canvas insert is the existing, working name-drag path).
Test: a component test asserting the thumbnail `<img>` is `draggable={false}` and the cell
carries `draggable` + an `onDragStart` that sets `application/x-cg-asset-id` to the asset id
(`apps/designer/tests/asset-thumb-drag.test.ts`). Branch: `fix/asset-thumb-drag`.
**DONE** — merged on `main` (PR #130, `adaac87`).

## [x] B-020 — adding an image fails intermittently (picker focus-timer races the change event) ⟨priority: high⟩ — focused fix

**Repro:**

1. In the Designer, open the Project Assets panel (or the Shared Library panel) and
   click **Add** → pick a single image in the OS file dialog.
2. Repeat several times.

**Expected:** every pick adds the image — reliably, no retries.
**Actual:** the import fails "most of the time" and only succeeds after a few tries —
the picked file is silently dropped (no loading tile, nothing imported). Intermittent
= a timing race.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev (Chrome 149); regression on
`feature/D-067-image-import-loading`, introduced by the D-069 freeze fix.
**Root cause:** the D-069 cancel-hang fix added an **unconditional** 400ms
window-`focus` fallback to `pickFiles` (`apps/designer/src/platform/createDesignerBridge.ts`)
to detect a cancelled dialog. But on a **real selection** the dialog's close fires
`focus` too, arming that timer; when its 400ms elapsed before the input's slightly-later
`change` event, the fallback resolved `[]` (a false cancel) and the real selection was
dropped. When `change` happened to beat the timer it worked — hence "try several times".
**Fix:** the host fires the input `cancel` event (Chrome 149; Baseline since
Chromium 113 / Firefox 91 / Safari 16.4 — the app's whole support matrix, incl. the
Firefox File-System-Access fallback path), so cancellation is detected by `cancel`
**alone** and the racing focus-timer fallback is **removed** — nothing pre-empts
`change`. Cancel still resolves `[]` via `cancel` (the D-069 freeze/leak stays fixed) and
a real selection settles via `change` unimpeded. `pickFiles` extracted to its own module
(`apps/designer/src/platform/pickFiles.ts`) for the regression test. No spec-level
behavior change (the D-069 freeze fix touched no OpenSpec spec) → focused fix, no OpenSpec
change. Regression test: `apps/designer/tests/pick-files.test.ts` (focus-then-late-`change`
delivers the selection; ×10 reliability; multi-select; cancel resolves `[]`). Branch:
`feature/D-067-image-import-loading` (same branch as the D-067 PR).
**DONE** — merged on `main` with D-067 (PR #138, `21d9174`).

## [x] B-021 — non-image/font files import as broken tiles (picker `accept` is a bypassable hint) ⟨priority: high⟩ — focused fix

**Repro:**

1. In the Designer, open the Project Assets panel (or Shared Library) and click
   **Add** → **Image…** (or **Add library image**).
2. In the OS dialog switch the file-type filter to **All files** (the picker opens on
   images, but with "All files" set you can navigate and select any format).
3. Select a **pdf / mp3 / mp4**.

**Expected:** unsupported files are rejected — not imported, no tile — and a
non-blocking notice says which were skipped; any valid image(s) in the same selection
still import.
**Actual:** the pdf/mp3/mp4 is added with a **broken thumbnail**. The `<input accept>`
attribute only _hints_ the dialog; it does not constrain what the user can actually
select, and the store imported whatever it was given (`AssetStore.importFile` falls back
to `kind: 'image'` for any extension; `SharedImageStore` is always `image`), so the
broken tile rendered.
**Env:** Browser / Designer; both Project Assets (image + font) and Shared Library.
Reproduces on `feature/D-067-image-import-loading`.
**Root cause:** `accept` is a UI hint, trivially bypassed via "All files". The selection
was never validated after the picker returned, and the stores accept any bytes.
**Fix:** validate the SELECTION after `pick()` returns, before `store`. New single
source of truth `apps/designer/src/shared/asset-types.ts` (allowed extensions + canonical
MIME per kind, mirroring the store's `KIND_BY_EXT`) drives BOTH the picker `accept` hint
(`acceptAttr`, now consumed by `pickFiles`) and the post-pick gate (`partitionSupported`
/ `isSupportedFile`, by extension primarily, MIME as a fallback). Both panels
(`SharedLibraryPanel.addImage` for image; `ProjectAssetsPanel.importKind` for image AND
font) now split the picked files: unsupported ones are dropped before any `begin()`/tile
or `store` and reported through the app's EXISTING toast (`designerStore.showNotice` →
the bottom-centre `<Toast>` in `App.tsx`, auto-dismiss + close), with a concise message
(`skippedFilesMessage` — count + first few names for a large batch); valid ones still
import + prepend. Mixed batch → valid import, rest noticed; all-invalid → just the toast.
No bridge/schema change (renderer-side gate) → focused fix, no OpenSpec change.
Regression tests: `apps/designer/tests/import-loading.test.ts`
("post-pick file-type validation (B-021)" — shared all-invalid, shared mixed,
project-assets Image…+pdf, project-assets Font…+non-font; asserting no store call, no
tile, the valid file still imports, and the toast message via `designerStore`). Branch:
`feature/D-067-image-import-loading` (same branch as the D-067 PR).
**DONE** — merged on `main` with D-067 (PR #138, `21d9174`).

## [x] B-015 — border-radius keyframes don't migrate on uniform↔per-corner toggle ⟨priority: high⟩ — archived: openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-15-migrate-radius-keyframes-on-toggle/

<!-- Change: openspec/changes/migrate-radius-keyframes-on-toggle -->

**Repro:**

1. یک shape با border-radius کلی (uniform) بساز و رویش حداقل یک کیفریم بگذار.
2. روی toggle بزن تا به حالت ۴تایی (per-corner) برود.
3. (سناریو ب) در حالت ۴تایی یک کیفریم اضافه کن — کار می‌کند و در پریویو دیده می‌شود.
4. به حالت uniform برگرد، سپس دوباره به ۴تایی.

**Expected:** کیفریم‌ها هنگام toggle مهاجرت کنند (گزینهٔ ۲):

- uniform→per-corner: مقدار و کیفریم‌های uniform به **هر چهار گوشه** کپی شوند (بدون از-دست-رفتن).
- per-corner→uniform: اگر هر چهار گوشه یکسان بودند همان مقدار/کیفریم‌ها؛ اگر متفاوت بودند **top-left** نماینده شود و سه گوشهٔ دیگر دور ریخته شوند.
- toggle هرگز کیفریمِ زنده را بی‌سکوت گم نکند؛ آنچه روی صفحه بود بعد از toggle همان رفتار را بدهد.

**Actual:** uniform و per-corner دو دستهٔ کیفریمِ **جدا**ی غیرمرتبط‌اند و toggle فقط نمایش را عوض می‌کند (هیچ داده‌ای منتقل نمی‌شود):

- uniform دارای کیفریم → ۴تایی: کیفریم‌های uniform دیده نمی‌شوند (مخفی، نه پاک — با toggle برگشت دوباره دیده می‌شوند).
- در ۴تایی کیفریم اضافه می‌شود و کار می‌کند، ولی بعد از رفت‌وبرگشت uniform↔per-corner، کیفریم‌های چهارگوشه ناپدید می‌شوند (به‌نظر toggle موقعِ جابجایی track را بازنویسی/پاک می‌کند — recon باید روشن کند).

**Env:** Browser / Designer dev؛ روی `main` بازتولید می‌شود.
**Notes:** Root cause در `BorderRadiusSection` / `toPerCorner` / `toUniform` در `apps/designer/src/renderer/features/inspector/StyleSection.tsx`. keyframe/schema-touching — **دو-فازی (recon-only اول)**. هم‌فایل با D-055؛ **بعد از merge شدنِ D-055** برداشته شود تا تداخلِ branch نشود. تستِ رگرسیون: رفت‌وبرگشتِ toggle با کیفریمِ uniform و per-corner، و موردِ چهار-گوشهٔ-متفاوت→uniform (انتخابِ top-left).

## [x] B-016 — gradient text color wipes the box background (text element only) ⟨priority: medium⟩ — fixed: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-16-fix-text-gradient-shadow-rendering/` (shared with B-017)

**Repro:**

1. یک المانِ **text** بساز که هم background داشته باشد (رنگ یا fill) هم رنگِ متن.
2. رنگِ متن را روی linear/radial gradient بگذار.

**Expected:** متنِ gradient و پس‌زمینهٔ جعبه مستقل رندر شوند — پس‌زمینه نباید
محو/clip شود.
**Actual:** پس‌زمینه ترنسپرنت می‌شود و جعبه gradient ِ متن را می‌گیرد. علت: متنِ
gradient از shorthand ِ `background: <gradient>` + `background-clip: text` روی همان
node استفاده می‌کند که `background-color`/`background-image` ِ پس‌زمینهٔ واقعی را پاک
می‌کند، و بعد `background-clip: text` هرچه مانده را به glyph می‌برد.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev؛ روی `main`. **فقط المانِ text** — ticker/clock/
sequence بعد از D-056 دیگر background ندارند (تداخل منتفی)، و ticker اصلاً colorFill
نداشت.
**Notes:** Root cause در `buildText` (`scene-builder.ts:328-337`): متنِ gradient و box
background روی یک node با هم تداخل دارند. `background-clip: text` همهٔ backgroundهای آن
node را به متن clip می‌کند، پس یک node نمی‌تواند هم متنِ gradient هم پس‌زمینهٔ جعبه
داشته باشد. **fix: یک node ِ جدا برای متنِ gradient** (یک wrapper ِ داخلیِ
layout-transparent) — box styling روی el ِ بیرونی می‌ماند. ریسکِ مهم: node ِ جدید نباید
auto-size/fit/measurement، alignment، RTL/bidi، یا target ِ inline-edit را عوض کند.
pre-existing (مستقل از D-052/D-056). تستِ رگرسیون: gradient متن + box background روی
text با هم رندر شوند (background clip نشود). keyframe/render-touching → **دو-فازی**.

## [x] B-017 — text-shadow lands ON gradient text instead of behind it ⟨priority: high⟩ — fixed: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-16-fix-text-gradient-shadow-rendering/` (shared with B-016)

**Repro:**

1. یک المانِ **text** بساز و رنگِ متن را روی linear/radial gradient بگذار.
2. یک **Text Shadow** بهش بده.

**Expected:** سایه **زیرِ** متن بیفتد (مثلِ حالتِ رنگِ solid)، و گرادیانِ متن کامل
دیده شود.
**Actual:** سایه **روی** متن می‌افتد و گرادیان را می‌پوشاند — متن شبیهِ «یک سایهٔ
خیلی ریز» دیده می‌شود. با تغییرِ پوزیشنِ سایه معلوم می‌شود گرادیانِ متن **درست** است
ولی زیرِ سایه پنهان شده.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev؛ هر دو preview و export (فرقی ندارد).
**Notes:** فقط وقتی رنگِ متن **گرادیان** است رخ می‌دهد؛ با رنگِ **solid** سایه درست
زیرِ متن می‌افتد. **box-shadow و shape درست‌اند** (مشکل فقط text-shadow روی متنِ
گرادیان). ریشهٔ محتمل: گرادیانِ متن از `background-clip: text` + `color: transparent`
استفاده می‌کند؛ روی متنِ transparent، لایه‌بندیِ text-shadow نسبت به گرادیان به‌هم
می‌خورد و سایه روی glyphها می‌افتد. **هم‌ریشه با B-016** (هر دو تداخلِ
`background-clip: text` روی node ِ مشترک‌اند). نامعلوم که pre-existing است یا رگرسیونِ
D-057 (recon از git روشن کند). احتمالاً یک fix ِ مشترکِ «node ِ جدا برای متنِ گرادیان»
هر دو B-016 و B-017 را حل می‌کند. render-touching → **دو-فازی، recon مشترک با B-016.**

## [ ] B-018 — Box-shadow Spread static value not writable (writeStaticAnimatable missing shadow.spread / boxShadow.spread cases) ⟨priority: high⟩

**Repro:**

1. Add a **shape** (or a **text** element) and open its **Box Shadow** section.
2. Type a value into the **Spread** field with no keyframe on it (a plain static edit).

**Expected:** the box-shadow spread (the CSS 4th length) updates — the shadow grows /
shrinks in the preview and persists.
**Actual:** nothing happens; `el.shadow.spread` is never written. A KEYFRAMED spread
already animated correctly — only the STATIC write was broken, on BOTH the shape
(`shadow.spread`) and the text box (`boxShadow.spread`).
**Env:** Browser / Designer; both preview and export.
**Root cause:** `writeStaticAnimatable` (`apps/designer/src/renderer/state/slices/timeline.ts`)
is a `switch (property)` with cases for `shadow.offsetX/offsetY/blur/color` and
`boxShadow.offsetX/offsetY/blur/color` but NO case for `shadow.spread` or
`boxShadow.spread`, so a static Spread edit (`commitAnimatable` → `writeStaticAnimatable`)
fell through and never wrote `el.shadow.spread`. Introduced by D-043 — the keyframed path
was tested, the static path was not, so the green gate didn't catch it.
**Fix:** add a combined `shadow.spread` / `boxShadow.spread` case writing `el.shadow.spread`
(both kinds' box-shadow lives on `el.shadow`; a NEGATIVE spread / shrink is valid — no
clamp), plus a store test driving the static write path on a shape AND a text element. NO
OpenSpec change — the merged D-043 spec already requires Spread to be settable. Branch:
`fix/B-018-spread-static-write`. Mark `[x]` on merge.

## [x] B-022 — scaleX/scaleY detaches the selection box, then rotate spins wrong ⟨priority: medium⟩ — archived: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-20-fix-selection-overlay-scale-rotate/`

> **Done** — merged (PR #141), archived
> `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-20-fix-selection-overlay-scale-rotate/`. Sibling of the
> fixed [B-004](#) (rotation handle position) — same selection-overlay transform module.

**Repro:**

1. Select a shape (or text).
2. In the Inspector set a NON-UNIFORM scale (e.g. Scale X = 2, Scale Y = 1) — ideally
   with a non-top-left anchor, and/or a rotation already applied.
3. Then rotate the shape via the corner rotate gesture.

**Expected:** the selection border + handles stay glued to the shape under ANY scale
(uniform or not), and rotation pivots about the shape's anchor correctly regardless of
the prior scale.
**Actual:** under non-uniform scale the selection border/handles drift off the shape;
rotating afterwards pivots/spins about the wrong point. The overlay draws a rotated
RECTANGLE of the scaled size, while the renderer applies `scale(sx,sy) rotate(deg)` about
the anchor — i.e. a PARALLELOGRAM (scale applied AFTER rotation, in scene axes). The two
only agree when the scale is uniform _and_ the anchor is top-left.
**Env:** Browser / Designer dev; reproduces on `main`. The authoring shapes are rendered
by the real `@cg/template-runtime` (`scene-builder.ts` → `composeTransform`) in the
`cgpreview` iframe, so the gizmo must match that exact transform.
**Root cause:** the selection overlay composes the transform differently from the renderer
and the hit-test:

- `apps/designer/src/renderer/features/canvas/Gizmo.tsx` — the visual box bakes scale into
  width/height (`w = size.w * t.scale.x`) with the top-left pinned at `position`, then
  rotates a RECTANGLE about `anchor%` of the SCALED box. Scale-before-rotate ≠ the
  renderer's scale-after-rotate; a rotated rectangle can never trace the renderer's
  parallelogram when `scaleX ≠ scaleY`.
- `apps/designer/src/renderer/features/canvas/geometry.ts` — `localToScene` (the resize /
  rotate math, line ~84) **omits scale entirely**, so resize grab points and the rotate
  pivot (`pivotClientFromGrab`) are computed as if scale = 1. Compare the authoritative
  inverse in `hit-test.ts` (`inverseToLocal`), which DOES invert `Scale·Rotate` about the
  anchor.

**Fix:** align the overlay's transform composition (and the rotate pivot/origin) with the
renderer/hit-test `Scale·Rotate`-about-anchor map: make `geometry.ts`'s forward map and
resize/rotate math scale-aware, and render the gizmo frame + handles at the projected
parallelogram corners (screen-sized handles, not a scaled box). Keep B-004's rotate-handle
fix intact.
**Regression:** unit-test the pure forward map round-trips against `hit-test.inverseToLocal`
under non-uniform scale + rotation, and that `computeResize` keeps the fixed corner glued
under scale; a component/E2E test that scales then rotates and asserts the box tracks the
shape; re-confirm B-004 (rotate updates handle position) still passes. Capability:
`designer-shapes` (MODIFIED — the selection-gizmo requirement). **DONE** — merged on `main`
(PR #141, `bc0aa4f`), archived `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-20-fix-selection-overlay-scale-rotate/`.

## [~] B-023 — repeater-mediated nesting cycle slips past the author-time guard ⟨priority: medium⟩ — fixed in D-086

> **Fixed (Phase A of D-086)** on `feat/D-086`, change
> `openspec/changes/per-composition-export-and-chrome/`. Surfaced by the D-086 export-scoping
> recon (`docs/recon/d-086-export-scoping.md`).

**Repro:**

1. Composition A contains a **repeater** whose child composition is B (A → B via a repeater
   edge).
2. Try to nest an instance of A inside B (or point B's repeater at A).

**Expected:** refused — A already reaches B, so nesting would close an infinite playout loop.
**Actual (pre-fix):** allowed. The author-time guard (`canNestComposition` →
`collectCompRefs`) only followed `composition` instance edges; a `repeater` also references a
child composition (`RepeaterElementSchema.compositionId`) but that edge was invisible to the
walker, so a repeater-mediated cycle passed the check and the runtime would recurse until its
depth cap.
**Root cause:** two ref-collectors had drifted — the field-aggregation collector
(`composition`-only, correct for fields) and the cycle-guard collector (also `composition`-only,
WRONG for reachability, since repeaters pull in a child composition's template + assets).
**Fix:** one shared, repeater-aware ref-collector in `@cg/shared-schema`
(`collectChildCompositionRefs` → `compositionClosure`), reused by the cycle guard. Field
aggregation deliberately keeps the `composition`-only collector (repeater rows don't form field
namespaces). **Regression:** `apps/designer/tests/composition-cycle-guard.test.ts` (repeater
cycle blocked, composition cycle still blocked, safe nesting allowed) +
`packages/shared-schema/tests/composition-fields.test.ts` (`compositionClosure` follows both
edge kinds). Capability: `designer-compositions` (MODIFIED — the cycle-guard requirement).

## [ ] B-024 — Width / height / scale must reject negative values ⟨priority: medium⟩

**What:** The width, height, and scale inputs must not accept negative values.
**Why:** Negative width/height/scale produce broken/invalid geometry.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the operator enters a negative value in width / height / scale THEN it is clamped to a non-negative value (or reverted) and no negative is committed

**Notes:** apps/designer/src/renderer/features/inspector/transform-fields.tsx (scale.x/scale.y) + the width/height size fields — add non-negative (min 0) clamping at commit.

## [~] B-025 — selection box (gizmo frame) doesn't render ⟨priority: high⟩ — fixed on `fix/B-025-selection-box-accent` (B-024 reserved in ROADMAP for the negative guard)

> **Fixed** — the gizmo frame is painted again; the teal accent is reverted to blue as a
> separate D-094 follow-up (see designer.md D-094).

**Repro:**

1. Select any shape on the canvas.

**Expected:** the selection frame (B-022's parallelogram outline) is visible around the shape,
on any background.
**Actual:** the corner handles render but the FRAME outline is invisible — the stroke is
absent/clipped, not teal-on-dark.
**Diagnosis (NOT a colour / D-094 token issue):** the frame's stroke reads `colors.accent`
(`Gizmo.tsx:198`, `strokeWidth={1}` at `:199`), which is a VALID token — at runtime the computed
stroke is `rgb(45,212,191)` (the teal). The frame is invisible because B-022 (`bc0aa4f`) draws
the polygon inside an SVG with `width={0} height={0}` (`Gizmo.tsx:190-191`) relying on
`overflow:'visible'` to paint outside its zero-size box; an ANCESTOR with `overflow:hidden`
clips that overflow paint, so the stroke never shows. The handles (separate absolutely-positioned
divs) are unaffected and render. **D-094 did NOT cause this** — D-094 (`5afc2f9`) changed only
`theme.ts` (accent value blue→teal + new `onAccent`) and `Button.css.ts`; it did not remove/rename
`accent` nor touch `Gizmo.tsx`. The invisibility predates and is independent of D-094.
**Root cause:** a zero-size SVG whose overflow paint is clipped by an ancestor `overflow:hidden`.
**Fix:** give the gizmo SVG a real size (`width/height: 100%`, covering the overlay) so the
polygon paints inside the viewport instead of as clipped overflow; `pointer-events:none` keeps the
handles on top and interactive. **Regression:**
`apps/designer/tests/e2e/selection-overlay-scale-rotate.spec.ts` — a new test asserts the frame's
owner SVG is non-zero-sized with a real, non-zero-width stroke; B-022's tracking + B-004 tests
still pass. Capability: `designer-shapes` (the selection-gizmo requirement — bug fix, no spec change).

## [x] B-026 — pasteboard extent clips shapes parked far off-frame ⟨priority: high⟩ — shipped (#157) + archived `openspec/changes/archive/…-pasteboard-extent-fits-content/`

> **Shipped + archived.** D-071 follow-up: the fixed 2× pasteboard extent now grows to contain
> off-frame content (grow-to-fit, Q1 = B). Merged on `main` (PR #157) and verified working (shapes
> park off-frame, stay visible/editable, export-excluded); the change `pasteboard-extent-fits-content`
> (capability `designer-canvas-viewport`, MODIFIED) is archived into `openspec/specs/`.
> **One deferred follow-up:** the whole-canvas jitter while dragging a shape FAR past the 2× boundary
> (a during-drag transient that settles correctly on drop) is filed as **B-027** [DEFERRED].

**Repro:**

1. Open the Designer, add a rectangle to the canvas.
2. Set its X position far off-frame — e.g. `x = 4000` (past the right pasteboard margin) or
   `x = -3000` (past the left margin) for a 1920×1080 frame.

**Expected:** the parked shape stays visible on the pasteboard and remains selectable/draggable so
the author can grab it back.
**Actual:** the shape leaves the iframe (which is sized to the FIXED 2× extent, scene
x∈[−960,2880]) and is **clipped — invisible and unselectable**. Parking a shape beyond ~50% of the
frame loses it.
**Env:** Browser + Designer (the authoring canvas only — export/broadcast unaffected).
**Diagnosis:** `geometry.pasteboardLayout(resolution)` (D-071 Phase B) is a pure function of the
resolution — `frame + PASTEBOARD_MARGIN_RATIO (0.5) × frame` per side — ignoring element positions.
The authoring iframe is sized to that extent and clips to its own element box, so content past the
margin is clipped away.
**Root cause:** a fixed, content-independent extent for a surface whose purpose is parking content
off-frame.
**Fix:** make the extent **grow-to-fit** (Q1 = B): a new `contentBounds(layers, currentFrame)` AABB
feeds `pasteboardLayout(resolution, content?)`, which grows the extent + frame offset only **past**
the 2× boundary (within it, byte-identical to today), shrinks back to the 2× floor (never below),
and clamps at `MAX_EXTENT_RATIO` (12×). The frame inset updates **live** via a `:root` CSS variable
on the existing `scene-replace` message (no reload), and an origin-shift `useLayoutEffect`
scroll-compensates so the visible content never jumps. `fitToViewport` still fits the FRAME;
export + broadcast (frame offset `{0,0}`) untouched. **Regression:**
`apps/designer/tests/content-bounds.test.ts` + `pasteboard.test.ts` (the B invariant, grow, shrink,
clamp, scroll-comp Δ) + `apps/designer/tests/e2e/pasteboard-extent.spec.ts` (far off all 4 sides
stays visible/selectable, within-2× no growth, left-growth no jump, shrink-to-2×, clamp).
Capability: `designer-canvas-viewport` (MODIFIED — the off-frame pasteboard requirement).

## [DEFERRED] B-027 — dragging a shape far off-frame jitters the whole canvas during the drag ⟨priority: medium⟩

> **DEFERRED follow-up to [[B-026]] / #157.** Grow-to-fit shipped and works; this is its one
> remaining rough edge. A during-drag COSMETIC transient only — it settles correctly on pointer-up,
> nothing is lost or mispositioned. Recommended fix below is decided; not yet scheduled.

**Repro:**

1. Open the Designer, add a shape, and drag it with the pointer FAR past the 2× pasteboard boundary
   (for a 1920×1080 frame the boundary is scene x∈[−960,2880], y∈[−540,1620]) — i.e. far enough that
   the extent grows and, on the LEFT/TOP, the frame origin shifts.

**Expected:** only the dragged shape follows the cursor; the frame and every other element stay put
(the dark area STRETCHING as the extent grows is expected and fine).
**Actual:** DURING the drag the WHOLE canvas (frame + other content) jitters/drifts per pointer-move,
then SETTLES CORRECTLY on pointer-up. Within-2× drags (no origin shift) are unaffected.
**Env:** Browser + Designer (authoring canvas only — export/broadcast unaffected; the grow-to-fit
extent + scroll-comp math are correct, this is purely a paint-timing artifact).
**Root cause:** cross-document SUB-FRAME timing. The host-side origin-shift scroll-comp
(`useLayoutEffect` on `frameOffset` → `offsetShiftScroll`, `CanvasArea.tsx`) runs SYNCHRONOUSLY per
pointer-move, but the thing it compensates for — the iframe `.cg-stage` inset (`--cg-frame-x/-y`) — is
applied ASYNCHRONOUSLY (it rides the rAF-throttled `scene-replace` postMessage, and each move also
does a full runtime rebuild via `await applyScene`). So the host scroll and the iframe inset don't
land in the same paint: for the lagging frame the content drifts by the per-move delta, then snaps
back. The shape-drag cursor→scene map is NOT involved (it's a pure pointer-client delta,
`startPos + (client − start)/scale`, origin-independent — confirmed, no feedback loop).
**NOT auto-testable (important):** the drift is a SUB-FRAME transient that self-corrects after each
frame, so Playwright cannot sample it — a prior fix attempt (PR #158, now closed) passed a new E2E
drag suite while the bug remained. Do NOT trust a green gate as proof this is fixed; verify by hand
(drag a shape far off-frame and watch the frame/other content during the gesture).
**Recommended fix (decided):** switch the pasteboard to a GENEROUS FIXED extent — drift-free by
construction. No dynamic origin shift, so: remove Seam 2 (the origin-shift scroll-comp), remove Seam
1's per-move inset postMessage (bake the inset once at load), and drop the `contentBounds`-driven
layout. Accept clipping only at extreme parking distances; the fixed margin is tunable (e.g. ~2× the
frame each side — i.e. roughly today's 2× baseline made permanent). This trades the grow-to-fit reach
for guaranteed smoothness. **Alternative** (only if grow-to-fit is ever wanted back): properly solve
the cross-document sync — force the iframe to flush layout synchronously right after the host writes
the inset, AND stop doing a full per-move runtime rebuild (re-inset without `applyScene`) so the inset
and scroll land in one paint.
**Touch points:** `apps/designer/src/renderer/features/canvas/CanvasArea.tsx` (the `frameOffset`
`useLayoutEffect` + the `scene-replace` rAF effect), `geometry.ts` (`pasteboardLayout` /
`offsetShiftScroll` / `contentBounds`), `apps/designer/src/platform/preview.ts` (the `--cg-frame-x/-y`
CSS-var inset + the scene-replace `frameOffset`). Capability: `designer-canvas-viewport`.
