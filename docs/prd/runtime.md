# Runtime — backlog

Features for the playout controller (`apps/runtime`). The CasparCG control path
itself lives in `caspar.md`. See `README.md` for the format.

## [x] R-001 — Import a `.vcg` template (upload) ⟨priority: medium⟩ — merged (#216, `5a0329d`) + archived

<!-- change: openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-07-import-vcg-template/ -->

**What:** Let the operator upload a `.vcg` file to register it as an available
template in the Runtime.
**Why:** The sidebar still says "drop a `.vcg` into the watched folder" — an
Electron-era flow. Browsers have no watched folder, so there's no way to add a
template today.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the operator uploads a `.vcg` THEN it is verified (`@cg/vcg-format.verify`)
  and added to the template registry
- WHEN a registered template is selected THEN it can be loaded onto the stack
  with its field schema in the Inspector
- WHEN a `.vcg` fails verification THEN the operator sees a clear error and
  nothing is registered
  **Notes:** `@cg/vcg-format` is isomorphic; extend the template registry in
  `apps/runtime/src/platform/MockRuntime.ts` (and the real registry later). Replace
  the sidebar placeholder copy in `App.tsx`.

## [ ] R-002 — Settings panel UI ⟨priority: low⟩

**What:** A settings view exposing the operator toggles (telemetry mode to start).
**Why:** The `settings` bridge (get/set/onChanged) is wired but has no UI.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the operator opens Settings and changes telemetry mode THEN it persists
  (localStorage) and survives reload
  **Notes:** `bridge.settings.*` already implemented in the mock; pairs with P-002
  (routing) if Settings becomes its own route.

## [x] R-003 — stage Inspector edits locally; only the Update button applies them to air ⟨priority: medium⟩ — merged via `stage-inspector-edits`, archived

<!-- change: openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-08-stage-inspector-edits/ -->

> **CLOSED — live-validated.** Inspector edits stage in a per-item draft overlay
> and reach the bridge only on an explicit Update (stack row + Inspector header)
> as ONE atomic `stack.update`; nothing is sent on change/blur/Enter. Discard
> reverts, dirty state is shown per-field + as a row/inspector "● draft" chip,
> drafts are per-item and survive selection switches, and Take/Out/Remove never
> auto-apply drafts. The recorded remount hazard is removed (controlled fields,
> no `JSON.stringify(value)` key). Operator-validated live on **CasparCG 2.5.0**
> (`69e8ad5`, 2026-07-08): all 7 checklist points pass, no regressions.

**What:** Change the Inspector's commit model for a live item: field edits (text,
list items, …) stage locally and are sent via `stack.update` ONLY when the operator
clicks **Update**; blur/Enter merely stages the value.
**Why:** Today every blur/Enter commits immediately and reaches the on-air output
at once (observed in the 2026-07-07 live session, CasparCG 2.5.0 `69e8ad5`) — a
half-finished or accidental edit goes straight to air. On-air safety needs an
explicit apply step.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the operator edits a field of an on-air item and blurs/Enters THEN the value
  is staged locally (visibly pending) and NO `stack.update` is sent
- WHEN the operator clicks Update THEN all staged edits are applied in one
  `stack.update` and the pending indication clears
- WHEN the operator re-selects the item without applying THEN staged edits are
  either kept (still pending) or discarded explicitly — never silently half-applied
  **Notes:** Interacts with B-044's pending-update status machine (the sticky
  "updating" badge) — design them together, ship separately. This is a dedicated
  future change, NOT part of the B-040 list-editor fix (which deliberately keeps
  the current commit semantics).
  **Known hazard this design must remove or explicitly handle** (found in the
  B-040 adversarial review, 2026-07-07): the Inspector's blur-commit triggers a
  whole-editor REMOUNT via the value-signature `key`
  (`key={fieldId-JSON.stringify(value)}`, `Inspector.tsx`); on the synchronous
  mock path the remount detaches the mousedown'ed node so the FIRST click on the
  list editor's ↑/↓/×/Add buttons is silently swallowed, and on the live bridge
  the delayed state push re-seeds the editor and can DISCARD keystrokes typed
  into another item's row between commit and push. Staged edits (no commit on
  blur) removes the trigger — but the chosen design must state how upstream
  value changes reconcile with in-progress local edits without a destructive
  remount.

## [ ] R-004 — template Library shows the manifest display name, not the raw id ⟨priority: low⟩

**What:** Library rows (and the import/Load copy) show the template's display
**name** from the `.vcg` manifest; the id stays discoverable as secondary info
(tooltip or small secondary text).
**Why:** The Library renders the raw template id (`LibraryPanel.tsx` shows
`t.templateId`) — a UUID for a real `.vcg` — which is meaningless to the operator
(observed in the 2026-07-07 live session).
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN a `.vcg` is imported THEN its Library row shows the manifest's display name,
  with the id available as a tooltip / secondary line
- WHEN a template has no usable name THEN the row falls back to the id
  **Notes:** `TemplateInfo` (`@cg/shared-ipc` `channels/templates.ts`) carries no
  name today — extend the schema (add `name`), populate it from the manifest at
  import (`templateDelivery.ts`), and pass it through both registries (bridge
  `TemplateRegistry` + `MockRuntime`).

## [ ] R-005 — delete a template from the Library ⟨priority: low⟩

**What:** Let the operator remove a registered template — a per-row delete button
AND a context-menu entry.
**Why:** The Library only grows; a mis-imported or stale `.vcg` cannot be removed
(observed in the 2026-07-07 live session).
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the operator deletes a template (button or context menu) THEN it disappears
  from the Library and from `templates.list`
- WHEN a template is deleted THEN the backend registry drops it too — incl. the
  bridge `TemplateRegistry` retained HTML and its served `/template/<id>` endpoint
- WHEN a stack item still references the template THEN deletion warns or is refused
  (decide in the change) — never silently broken stack rows
  **Notes:** Needs a new `templates.remove` channel in `@cg/shared-ipc`, removal
  semantics in `tools/caspar-bridge` (`template-registry.ts` + the HTTP serve list),
  the `MockRuntime` equivalent, and the `LibraryPanel` UI (button + context menu).

## [ ] R-006 — surface + recover the boot-time backend choice (no silent per-session mock) ⟨priority: low⟩

**What:** When the boot-time bridge probe fails and the session pins to
`offline-mock`, make that state prominent and recoverable — e.g. a **Reconnect**
affordance that re-probes the bridge and attaches LIVE (or guides the operator
through an explicit reload + re-import) instead of requiring the operator to
discover a manual refresh.
**Why:** The backend is chosen once at boot (`createRuntimeBridge.ts`: probe
refused/timed out → persistent `offline-mock` for the whole session). In the
2026-07-07 live session the page had booted on the mock — commands "never reached
CasparCG" and only a page refresh + re-import attached the real bridge. The
`LinkIndicator` does show `offline-mock`, but the mode is easy to miss and there is
no recovery path in the UI.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the session is on `offline-mock` THEN the UI states it prominently and
  offers a reconnect/retry affordance
- WHEN the operator triggers reconnect and the bridge is reachable THEN the session
  attaches LIVE (or is explicitly guided to reload), and the operator is told which
  templates need re-import (the bridge's in-memory registry starts empty)
  **Notes:** Keep the deliberate current model — no silent mid-session fallback to
  the mock; the gap is only visibility + recovery of the boot-time choice. Related:
  the B-038 open follow-up (re-deliver retained template HTML on reconnect).

## [ ] R-007 — Runtime control styling + interaction feedback ⟨priority: medium⟩

**What:** Give the Runtime a real design-system layer: professional, legible
controls with unmistakable interaction feedback (hover / active-pressed /
focus-visible / disabled), an async-feedback contract for every button whose
action is a bridge round-trip (instant press → busy-while-in-flight → success →
inline error on rejection), and a coherent visual language for every status /
badge / chip state. Includes the **TAKE → PLAY** button label rename (label +
aria text only — IPC channels and API names stay as-is) and styling the R-003
dirty-dot / "● draft" chip / Discard control and the B-044 UNCONFIRMED badge.
**Why:** Styling today is per-component inline `const styles` objects. Inline
styles cannot express `:hover` / `:active` / `:focus-visible`, so controls feel
dead — no press feedback, no hover, no focus rings — and there is no busy or
success signal when a command round-trips to the bridge (observed across the
2026-07-07/08 live sessions). The operator can't tell a click registered, can't
tell a command is in flight, and a rejection is easy to miss.
**Acceptance:**

- WHEN the operator hovers / presses / tab-focuses any control THEN it shows a
  distinct hover, pressed, and visible focus-visible state (no layout shift
  between states)
- WHEN a bridge-round-trip button is clicked THEN it shows instant pressed
  feedback, becomes busy (disabled + `aria-busy`, double-fire guarded) while ITS
  OWN request is in flight — a spinner-or-equivalent appearing only if the
  request exceeds ~150ms and held ≥300ms once shown — a brief success affordance
  on resolve, and a visible error near the control on rejection (never
  console-only)
- WHEN a request's WS ack clears the button's busy state THEN the stack badge may
  still be settling (B-044) — the two are decoupled and read as distinct
- WHEN every stack badge state renders (ON AIR / READY / IDLE / UPDATING /
  UNCONFIRMED / ERROR / EXIT / TAKING) plus the R-003 dirty-dot and "● draft"
  chip THEN each has a coherent, legible visual with adequate dark-theme contrast
- WHEN `prefers-reduced-motion` is set THEN spinners / transitions are replaced
  by a static busy affordance
- WHEN the change ships THEN the "TAKE" button reads "PLAY" (label + aria); no
  behavior changes (R-003 semantics, the B-044 lifecycle, verbs, escaping all
  stay exactly as-is), and the existing Playwright specs stay green (the PLAY
  selector update is the one deliberate change)
  **Notes:** Introduces a styling MECHANISM (a global stylesheet with classes +
  CSS custom properties fed from `theme.ts`, or shared styled primitives — no new
  UI framework / styling dependency) and shared primitives (Button variants,
  TextInput, TextArea, NumberField preserving R-003's in-progress-text behavior,
  StatusBadge, DraftChip). Give PLAY / UPDATE / OUT / REMOVE a deliberate visual
  hierarchy (an on-air action must not look like a neutral sibling of Remove).
  Keeps the dark broadcast-console look and the sacred air-state colors.
  Cross-refs: R-003 (dirty/Discard affordances), B-044 (UNCONFIRMED badge).
