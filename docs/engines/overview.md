## The one-sentence version

The **Designer** edits a **`Scene`** (a [`@cg/shared-schema`](../../packages/shared-schema)
Zod document); [`@cg/template-runtime`](../../packages/template-runtime) turns that
same `Scene` into live DOM and drives its animation + playout; the **same runtime
code** powers the Designer's preview, the exported single-file HTML, and CasparCG
playout — so **what the Designer shows IS what airs**.

### 1. Authoring → `Scene`

The Designer's canvas editor and inspector mutate a `Scene` in renderer state.
Every domain shape (elements, fields, bindings, keyframe tracks, lifecycle,
playout, nested compositions) is a **Zod schema in `@cg/shared-schema`** — the
single source of truth for the data model. The editor never invents structure the
schema doesn't define; **a data-model change starts in the schema**, then flows to
the editor UI and the runtime renderer (the "Where features go" map in
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md)).

### 2. `Scene` → live DOM (the runtime)

[`@cg/template-runtime`](../../packages/template-runtime)'s `createRuntime(scene)`:

- **builds** the DOM tree from the scene (scene-builder),
- **applies** the current field values onto that DOM by walking the scene's
  declared bindings (`applyFieldValues`),
- **animates** keyframed properties per frame (animation-applier + keyframe-eval),
- **drives** the broadcast lifecycle and playout timing — entrance → hold → exit,
  auto-out / loop / content-driven (PlayoutController + FrameDriver),
- cascades all of the above through **nested composition instances**.

The renderer talks to its "backend" only through the typed `window.cg` bridge; the
runtime is the thing on the other side of that seam for graphics. See the
[template-runtime deep-dive](../../packages/template-runtime/README.md) for how it's
built and how to extend it.

### 3. `Scene` → preview / export (same runtime, three outputs)

The runtime source is bundled once into two payloads
(`apps/designer/scripts/bundle-runtime.mjs` → `cg-runtime.js` ESM +
`cg-runtime.iife.js` IIFE) so all three consumers run identical logic:

| Output               | Who runs it                   | How the runtime is delivered                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preview iframe**   | Designer, live while editing  | ESM bundle injected via `srcDoc`                                              |
| **`.vcg` package**   | the Runtime app / a CG server | ESM bundle inside the package ([`@cg/vcg-format`](../../packages/vcg-format)) |
| **Single-file HTML** | CasparCG (file://)            | IIFE bundle, exposes `window.CG`, targets old CEF                             |

The exported `index.html` calls `createRuntime(scene)` then
`installCasparGlobals(runtime)`, which wires CasparCG's bare global calls
(`play`/`update`/`stop`/`next`/`remove`, JSON **or** legacy XML payloads) to the
typed runtime.

## The editor ↔ schema ↔ runtime triangle

```
        edits / validates            renders / drives
 editor ───────────────► Scene ◄─────────────── runtime
   ▲      (shared-schema)        (template-runtime)  │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        preview reflects exactly what the runtime produces
```

- **Schema is the contract.** Both the editor and the runtime depend on
  `@cg/shared-schema`; neither encodes the data model independently. Change the
  schema and both sides adapt.
- **The runtime is the renderer of record.** The Designer does not have a second,
  "preview-only" renderer — it embeds the real runtime. This is deliberate: it
  removes preview/playout drift.
- **Behaviour lives in specs, not prose.** The _what_ (the behavioural contract for
  lifecycle/timing, animation, bindings) is captured in OpenSpec living specs and
  changes under [`openspec/`](../../openspec); the engine docs describe _how it's
  built_. Don't duplicate behaviour between them.

## Where the engines live

| Engine / package                                          | Responsibility                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`@cg/shared-schema`](../../packages/shared-schema)       | The data model (Zod): scenes, elements, fields, bindings, animation, lifecycle, playout, compositions. |
| [`@cg/template-runtime`](../../packages/template-runtime) | Build DOM from a scene, bind data, animate, drive lifecycle/playout. **The heart.**                    |
| [`@cg/vcg-format`](../../packages/vcg-format)             | Isomorphic pack / unpack / verify of `.vcg` template packages.                                         |
| [`@cg/text-shaping`](../../packages/text-shaping)         | Persian/RTL-aware transforms (digits, dates, truncation) used by bindings.                             |
| [`@cg/lottie-bridge`](../../packages/lottie-bridge)       | Lottie integration (field overrides land with M3.3).                                                   |
| `apps/designer`                                           | Canvas editor, inspector, preview, exporters.                                                          |
| `apps/runtime`                                            | Playout controller (CasparCG via the local bridge / mock).                                             |
